## Questions
1. Implementation Language --> Java
2. Front-end --> Text file that user inputs, Parser in Java
3. Back-end --> Java + Biweekly library + dependencies

## Discussed Changes
1. Followup with TA regarding features

## Implementation Plan
1. Front-end: As of now, the user enters input into a txt file
2. Back-end: Biweekly library is being used to generate ics file
3. A running rough implementation; with **text file user input**, and **Java** being used to parse user input (_Completed_)
4. Find a library for Calendar implementation; Biweekly (_Completed_)
5. Create and test calendar functionality in its own Class (_Completed_)
6. Include a form of persistent memory in disk storage; JSON file (_TODO_)
7. Incorporate calendar functionality into parsing algorithm (_TODO_)
8. Test rigorously (_TODO_)
